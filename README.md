Abstract—In reality,many jobs of the same type can be done together. Sever spends less time doing them together than doing them one by one. The paper considers the queuing problem about the jobs that can be done together. We consider the situations with waste and without waste. We introduce three different strategies:MASTFS,FCFS and Mechanic and discuss the limitations and benefits of them. Also, we do some experiments trying to compare them. And find that MASTFS perform well when there’s no waste and FCFS and Mechanic performs well when there’s waste. And each strategy perform well on some extreme situations.
